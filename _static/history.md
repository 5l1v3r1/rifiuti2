`Rifiuti2` is a rewrite of `rifiuti`, a tool of identical purpose written
by Foundstone.[^1] Quoting from [the original FoundStone page][1]:

> Many computer crime investigations require the reconstruction of
> a subject's recycle bin. Since this analysis technique is executed
> regularly, we researched the structure of the data found in the Recycle
> Bin repository files (INFO2 files). Rifiuti, the Italian word meaning
> &ldquo;trash&rdquo;, was developed to examine the contents of the INFO2 file in
> the Recycle Bin. &hellip; Rifiuti is built to work on multiple platforms
> and will execute on Windows (through Cygwin), Mac OS X, Linux, and
> \*BSD platforms.

However, since [the original rifiuti][3] (last updated 2004) can't analyze
recycle bin from any localized version of Windows (restricted to
English), this rewrite effort is born to overcome the limitation. Later
rifiuti2 was improved to add support for Vista format recycle bin, XML
output and other extra features not available from original version.

[^1]: Foundstone was later [purchased by Mcafee][4] as a security consulting
      division. Though selected free tools are still available for download
      under McAfee, rifiuti is not one of them now.
