==== What is rifiuti2? ====

rifiuti2 is a rewrite of rifiuti, a great tool from Foundstone folks
for analyzing Windows Recycle Bin INFO2 file. But since rifiuti
(last updated 2004) is restricted to English version of Windows
(fail to analyze any non-latin character), thus this rewrite.


==== Features ====

* Supports legacy Windows file names in any character set supported by iconv(), as well as Unicode ones
* Handles recycle bin up to Windows 10 (no more uses INFO2 file since Vista)
* Preliminary guard against specially crafted recycle bin files
* Supports output in XML format as well as original tab-delimited text
* Enables localization (that is, translatable)

Latest features can be found in NEWS file.


==== Compiling ====

Similar to all programs using autotools, it can be compiled quickly with
this command:

    ./configure && make

====== Build requirement on Linux ======

* Basic development toolchain (autoconf, automake, make, binutils, gcc...)
* glib >= 2.6 (development libraries and headers available on virtually all
		Linux distributions)

====== Build requirement on Windows ======

* MSYS2 (https://msys2.github.io/)
  - [Beware of first time package
  update!!!](http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/)
  - Old MSYS 1.0 might still work but not guaranteed since 0.6.0
* Glib runtime AND development packages
  - Install with `pacman -Sy mingw-w64-x86_64-glib2` for 64bit build, and/or
  - Install with `pacman -Sy mingw-w64-i686-glib2` for 32bit build

==== Supported platform ====

It has been tested on Linux, Windows XP and Windows 7.
More compatibility fix for other architectures welcome.
