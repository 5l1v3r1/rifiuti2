Obviously, all credits must go to Keith Jones and all the folks at
Foundstone. Without their analysis on Windows Recycle Bin it is much
more difficult to fully dissect it. Their elaborate white paper and
original version of rifiuti are available from ODESSA project:

There are more people to say thanks:

Hilda Chan (Providing Chinese Vista Recycle Bin sample data)
Anthony Wong <ypwong@gmail.com> (Providing manpage & original Debian packaging)

Finally, rifiuti2 won't have extensive testing without several OSS projects
and software archives:

1. winworldpc.com library, hosting many obsolete and unpurchaseable
   versions of Windows, especially ancient beta versions which provide
   insight on how Windows has evolved.

2. VirtualBox and Qemu, without their excellent virtual machine emulation
   it is simply impossible to test program behavior on different platforms.

3. A few website hosting obsolete service packs and ancient IE installers,
   relieving some pain on network access and tools installation in virtual
   machines:

   - Folks at browser.evolt.org who mirrored many ancient IE versions
   - Mirror for all NT service packs in sdfox7.com/winntsp.htm
   - There can be other website I forgot to mention
