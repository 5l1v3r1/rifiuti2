Quite a long time since previous release (6.5 years). Actually I have thought
about abandoning the software before, but some anonymous users persuaded me
to keep it up by submitting patch for Windows 10 format. There was no way
to get any info for this bug reporter (not even email address, it was
mangled inside Google Code), but still I would want to say thank you to
this anonymous user!

Version 0.6.0 [available for download here][1], with pre-compiled Windows binary
and several formats of source archives (tarball, zipball, tar/xz archive).
