# GitHub can automatically set these properties accordingly for user
# page and project page.
#
# Indeed you can still set the properties yourself, in that case don't
# forget to change the username and projectname to YOUR username and project

# url is the website URL up to host name, without trailing slash
#url: "https://username.github.io"

# For GitHub user page, baseurl is empty string. Don't set to "/".
# For GitHub project page, set it to project name with leading slash,
# e.g. "/myproject". However, don't add trailing slash.
