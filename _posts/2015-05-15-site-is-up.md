Finally get the [Github page][1] set up done with [Jekyll][2], instead of
simply using `README.md` as a boilerplace webpage. Some learning curve is
involved, but luckily not steep.

Hope more about the analysis of different recycle bin formats can be
written up later, in particular the less common Windows versions. So
far nobody has covered the format used in Windows 10 (only slightly
different from Vista though), as well as the `INFO` format used
in Win95.
